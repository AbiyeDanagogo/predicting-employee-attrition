# predicting-employee-attrition

This was my capstone project for the Big Data Analytics with Python course from Utiva. I worked with the excel file called TakenMind-Python-Analytics-Problem-case-study-1-1.
The file contained data for a company X that is trying to control attrition. There are two sets of data: “Existing employees” and “Employees who have left”. 
Following attributes are available for every employee:

* Satisfaction Level
* Last evaluation
* Number of projects
* Average monthly hours
* Time spent at the company
* Whether they have had a work accident
* Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years
* Departments (column sales)
* Salary
* Whether the employee has left

## Objective
1. What type of employees are leaving? 
2. Determine which employees are prone to leave next.
3. Give your recommendations

## Machine Learning Model

I also created a machine learning model using random forests, that can be used to predict employee attrition with 99% accuracy.

## Certificate
This is to certify that I completed the course from Utiva.
